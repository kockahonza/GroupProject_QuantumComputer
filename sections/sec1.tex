Since Rutherfordâ€™s discovery of the nucleus in the early 19th century,\cite{noauthor_discovery_nodate} nuclear physics has been an intense area of research and has led to many discoveries from the neutron in 1932 by James Chadwick.
The nucleus is composed of two fermions (proton and neutron) with similar mass and is held together by the strong nuclear force.
