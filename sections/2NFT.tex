\section{The Theory of nuclear forces}
Ever since it was discovered that the nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, scientists have been working out how it is held together.
The logical answer would be a force, though the only two forces known at the time were the gravitational and the electromagnetic.
However, neither of these could be the one as protons and neutrons don't have opposite charges and the gravitational force is far too weak to explain the phenomenon.
% So it was concluded it must be another force, called the nuclear force, which we now know to be residual effects of the strong force between quarks, another fundamental force.
So it was concluded it must be another force, named the nuclear force. \cite{hergert_guided_2020, machleidt_chiral_2011}
