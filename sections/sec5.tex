\section{Jans notes}
Ok, I'm taking over this section for now
\begin{itemize}

\item
For "types" fo QCters I see photonic and trapped ion for now at least.

\item
Trapped ion type seems quite nice, apparently it works well, but they haven't really scaled to hundreds of qubits.


\item
Found this thing called DiVincezo criteria which might be nice to mention or something, it's 5 criteria that need to be met for a given
hypothetical QCter type/implementation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A physical system containing well-defined 2 level quantum systems (qubits) which can be isolated from the environment.
    \item The ability to initialize this system in a well defined, determinate state.
    \item A set of universtal quantum gates which can be applied to each qubit or possibly pairs (or more) of them.
    \item Qubit decoherence times much greater than times for quantum gates to be applied.
    \item The ability to read out qubit state with high accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
