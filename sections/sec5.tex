\section{Applications of MS outside nuclear force theory}

Mass spectrometry has a long history and wide adoption out with nuclear physics both in research and commercially.
MS are essential for chemical analysis â€“ often used to determine the isotopes present in a mixture.
In chemical and biomedical research, they are used frequently for structural elucidation where MS can give information about molecular structure.
