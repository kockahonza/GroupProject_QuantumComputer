\section{Michael's Section}
Finding a physical representation of qubits that fulfil all the mathematical requirements is not easy.
Gaining control over a single quantum system has been a want since about 1970. word this so better
It is possible to see quantum effects on a vast number of combined quantum systems such as in superconductors. \cite{nielsen_quantum_2010}
Or in particle collisions again quantum effects are observed however there isn't control over a single quantum system.
Qubits are the physical realisation of controlling a single quantum system and its state.
You require a system with many degrees of freedom that can encode quantum information (qubits). \cite{bergou_quantum_2021}

\subsection{Optical Photon Quibit}

{\bf Why Photons?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Photons are massless, chargeless and don't interact with each other or other mass much. \cite{nielsen_quantum_2010}
    \item Can be guided long distances without much energy loss using optical fibers. \cite{nielsen_quantum_2010}
    \item Quantum information can be transmitted over long distances using photons as demonstrated by quantum entanglement over 1200km. \cite{yin_satellite-based_2017}
    \item photons can maintain entanglement over long distances and time period allowing the transmission quantum information. - this supper secure wow \cite{thibault_team_nodate}
\end{itemize}

{\bf How photons?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The transverse polarisation state of a photon can be used to represent qubits. 
    These are vertical, horizontal linear and left, right circular polarization. \cite{bergou_quantum_2021}
    
    \item These states can also be maintained - in isotropic materials photons polarization does not change as it propagates. \cite{bergou_quantum_2021}
    
    \item $\left\vert 0 \right\rangle = \left\vert H\right\rangle $ and $\left\vert 1 \right\rangle = \left\vert V\right\rangle $ where H and V are horizontal and vertical polarisation. \cite{bergou_quantum_2021}

\end{itemize}

{\bf Need a single photon source}
\begin{itemize}
    \item lasers with very low output can emit single electrons... but 90$\%$ of the time no photon is emitted and when there is a photon emitted 5$\%$ of than one is emitted.\cite{nielsen_quantum_2010}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item so lasers CANNOT be used - we need sources that can be synchronised not possible if you don't know when a photon is actual coming out
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1em}

{\bf Quantum Dot}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum dots can/could (not sure where we are) be a single photon source
    \item from wiki quantum dots seem to be `semiconducting particles a few nanometers in size' therefor shining
\end{itemize}
