\section{Nuclei mass measurements with regard to nuclear force theory}
This section looks extensively into the Nucleon pairing energy, nuclear mass measurements and magic numbers.
Analysis of nucleon binding energies is achieved by investigating the magic numbers of nucleons.
The magic number represents stable atoms that are less likely to be radioactive. 
Before discovering the standard 2, 8, 30, 28, 50, 82, 126 magic numbers, higher values of 184, 258, 350, and 462 are thought to exist. 
The existence of these number are predicted and are calculated based on the Binomial coefficient.
