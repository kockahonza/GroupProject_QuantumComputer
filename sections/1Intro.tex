\section{Introduction}
Since Rutherfordâ€™s discovery of the nucleus in the early 19th century,\cite{noauthor_discovery_nodate} nuclear physics has been an intense area of research and has led to many discoveries from the neutron in 1932 by James Chadwick \cite{noauthor_discovery_nodate-1} and later the strong force to nuclear fission and its capabilities as a method to produce low carbon electricity.
The nucleus is composed of two fermions (proton and neutron) with similar mass and is held together by the strong nuclear force.
