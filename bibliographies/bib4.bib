	abstract = {One of the most cited books in physics of all time, Quantum Computation and Quantum
Information remains the best textbook in this exciting field of science. This 10th
Anniversary Edition includes a new Introduction and Afterword from the authors
setting the work in context.
This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable effects as fast quantum
algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, and quantum
error-correction. Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced, before
moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems
faster than “classical” computers, and its real-world implementation. It concludes with
an in-depth treatment of quantum information.
Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for
courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in
physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.},

	abstract = {Long-distance entanglement distribution is essential both for foundational tests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss, however, the previously achieved distance was limited to {\textasciitilde}100 km. Here, we demonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two locations separated by 1203 km on the Earth, through satellite-to-ground twodownlink with a sum of length varies from 1600 km to 2400 km. We observe a survival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37±0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effective link efficiency at 1200 km in this work is over 12 orders of magnitude higher than the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through the best commercial telecommunication fibers with a loss of 0.16 {dB}/km.},
