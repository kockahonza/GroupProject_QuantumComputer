  abstract = {Quantum simulation of spin models can provide insight into problems that are difficult or impossible to study with classical computers. Trapped ions are an established platform for quantum simulation, but only systems with fewer than 20 ions have demonstrated quantum correlations. We studied quantum spin dynamics arising from an engineered, homogeneous Ising interaction in a two-dimensional array of 9Be+ ions in a Penning trap. We verified entanglement in spin-squeezed states of up to 219 ions, directly observing 4.0 ± 0.9 decibels of spectroscopic enhancement, and observed states with non-Gaussian statistics consistent with oversqueezed states. The good agreement with ab initio theory that includes interactions and decoherence lays the groundwork for simulations of the transverse-field Ising model with variable-range interactions, which are generally intractable with classical methods.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional arrays of trapped-ion qubits are attractive platforms for scalable quantum information processing. Sufficiently rapid reloading capable of sustaining a large array, however, remains a significant challenge. Here with the use of a continuous flux of pre-cooled neutral atoms from a remotely located source, we achieve fast loading of a single ion per site while maintaining long trap lifetimes and without disturbing the coherence of an ion quantum bit in an adjacent site. This demonstration satisfies all major criteria necessary for loading and reloading extensive two-dimensional arrays, as will be required for large-scale quantum information processing. Moreover, the already high loading rate can be increased by loading ions in parallel with only a concomitant increase in photo-ionization laser power and no need for additional atomic flux.},

  abstract = {Trapped ions are among the most promising systems for practical quantum computing (QC). The basic requirements for universal QC have all been demonstrated with ions, and quantum algorithms using few-ion-qubit systems have been implemented. We review the state of the field, covering the basics of how trapped ions are used for QC and their strengths and limitations as qubits. In addition, we discuss what is being done, and what may be required, to increase the scale of trapped ion quantum computers while mitigating decoherence and control errors. Finally, we explore the outlook for trapped-ion QC. In particular, we discuss near-term applications, considerations impacting the design of future systems of trapped ions, and experiments and demonstrations that may further inform these considerations.},

  abstract = {Monolithic integration of control technologies for atomic systems is a promising route to the development of quantum computers and portable quantum sensors1–4. Trapped atomic ions form the basis of high-fidelity quantum information processors5,6 and high-accuracy optical clocks7. However, current implementations rely on free-space optics for ion control, which limits their portability and scalability. Here we demonstrate a surface-electrode ion-trap chip8,9 using integrated waveguides and grating couplers, which delivers all the wavelengths of light required for ionization, cooling, coherent operations and quantum state preparation and detection of Sr+ qubits. Laser light from violet to infrared is coupled onto the chip via an optical-fibre array, creating an inherently stable optical path, which we use to demonstrate qubit coherence that is resilient to platform vibrations. This demonstration of CMOS-compatible integrated photonic surface-trap fabrication, robust packaging and enhanced qubit coherence is a key advance in the development of portable trapped-ion quantum sensors and clocks, providing a way towards the complete, individual control of larger numbers of ions in quantum information processing systems.},

  abstract = {Trapped-ion systems are among the most promising hardware candidates for large scale quantum computing and quantum simulation. In order to scale up such devices, it is necessary to engineer extreme-high vacuum (XHV) environments to prevent background gas from disrupting the ion crystal. Here we present a new cryogenic ion trapping system designed for long time storage of large ion chains. Our apparatus is based on a segmented-blade ion trap enclosed in a 4 K cryostat, which enables us to routinely trap and hold over 100 171Yb+ ions for hours in a linear configuration, due to low background gas pressure from differential cryo-pumping. We characterize the XHV cryogenic environment measuring pressures below by recording both inelastic and elastic collisions between the ion chain and the molecular background gas. We also demonstrate coherent one and two-qubit operations and nearly equidistant ion spacing for chains of up to 44 ions using anharmonic axial potentials, in order to enable better detection and single ion addressing in large ion arrays. We anticipate that this reliable production and lifetime enhancement of large linear ion chains will enable quantum simulation of models that are intractable with classical computer modeling.},
