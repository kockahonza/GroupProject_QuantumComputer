  abstract = {Quantum simulation of spin models can provide insight into problems that are difficult or impossible to study with classical computers. Trapped ions are an established platform for quantum simulation, but only systems with fewer than 20 ions have demonstrated quantum correlations. We studied quantum spin dynamics arising from an engineered, homogeneous Ising interaction in a two-dimensional array of 9Be+ ions in a Penning trap. We verified entanglement in spin-squeezed states of up to 219 ions, directly observing 4.0 ± 0.9 decibels of spectroscopic enhancement, and observed states with non-Gaussian statistics consistent with oversqueezed states. The good agreement with ab initio theory that includes interactions and decoherence lays the groundwork for simulations of the transverse-field Ising model with variable-range interactions, which are generally intractable with classical methods.},

Sufficiently rapid reloading capable of sustaining a large array, however, remains a significant challenge. Here with the use of a continuous flux of pre-cooled neutral atoms from a remotely located source, we achieve fast loading of a single ion per site while maintaining long trap lifetimes and without disturbing the coherence of an ion quantum bit in an adjacent site. This demonstration satisfies all major criteria necessary for loading and reloading extensive two-dimensional arrays, as will be required for large-scale quantum information processing. Moreover, the already high loading rate can be increased by loading ions in parallel with only a concomitant increase in photo-ionization laser power and no need for additional atomic flux.},

  abstract = {Universal logic gates for two quantum bits (qubits) form an essential ingredient of quantum computation. Dynamical gates have been proposed1,2 in the context of trapped ions; however, geometric phase gates (which change only the phase of the physical qubits) offer potential practical advantages because they have higher intrinsic resistance to certain small errors and might enable faster gate implementation. Here we demonstrate a universal geometric π-phase gate between two beryllium ion-qubits, based on coherent displacements induced by an optical dipole force. The displacements depend on the internal atomic states; the motional state of the ions is unimportant provided that they remain in the regime in which the force can be considered constant over the extent of each ion's wave packet. By combining the gate with single-qubit rotations, we have prepared ions in an entangled Bell state with 97\% fidelity—about six times better than in a previous experiment3 demonstrating a universal gate between two ion-qubits. The particular properties of the gate make it attractive for a multiplexed trap architecture4,5 that would enable scaling to large numbers of ion-qubits.},

The book is written as a textbook, with the treatment as a whole appropriate for graduate or postgraduate students, while earlier chapters are also suitable for final-year undergraduates.

In order to scale up such devices, it is necessary to engineer extreme-high vacuum (XHV) environments to prevent background gas from disrupting the ion crystal. Here we present a new cryogenic ion trapping system designed for long time storage of large ion chains. Our apparatus is based on a segmented-blade ion trap enclosed in a 4 K cryostat, which enables us to routinely trap and hold over 100 171Yb+ ions for hours in a linear configuration, due to low background gas pressure from differential cryo-pumping. We characterize the XHV cryogenic environment measuring pressures below by recording both inelastic and elastic collisions between the ion chain and the molecular background gas. We also demonstrate coherent one and two-qubit operations and nearly equidistant ion spacing for chains of up to 44 ions using anharmonic axial potentials, in order to enable better detection and single ion addressing in large ion arrays. We anticipate that this reliable production and lifetime enhancement of large linear ion chains will enable quantum simulation of models that are intractable with classical computer modeling.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate unprecedentedly long lifetimes for electron spin superposition states of a single trapped \$\$\^\{40\}\$\$Ca\$\$\^+\$\$ion. For a Ramsey measurement, we achieve a \$\$1\{/\}\textbackslash sqrt\{e\}\$\$coherence time of 300(50)~ms, while a spin-echo experiment yields a coherence time of 2.1(1)~s. The latter corresponds to residual effective rms magnetic field fluctuations \$\$\{\textbackslash le \}2.7\textbackslash times 10\^\{-12\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash hbox \{T\}\$\$during a measurement time of about 1500~s. The suppression of decoherence induced by fluctuating magnetic fields is achieved by combining a two-layer \$\$\textbackslash mu\$\$-metal shield, which reduces external magnetic noise by 20–30~dB for frequencies of 50~Hz–100~kHz, with Sm\$\$\_2\$\$Co\$\$\_\{17\}\$\$permanent magnets for generating a quantizing magnetic field of 0.37~mT. Our results extend the coherence time of the simple-to-operate trapped-ion spin qubit to ultralong coherence times which so far have been observed only for magnetic insensitive transitions in atomic qubits with hyperfine structure.},

  abstract = {We propose an implementation of quantum logic gates via virtual vibrational excitations in an ion-trap quantum computer. Transition paths involving unpopulated vibrational states interfere destructively to eliminate the dependence of rates and revolution frequencies on vibrational quantum numbers. As a consequence, quantum computation becomes feasible with ions whose vibrations are strongly coupled to a thermal reservoir.},

By only optimizing the allocation of the arrival times in a pulse train sequence the gate is implemented in times faster than the trapping oscillation period T {$<$} 2π/ω. Such gates allow us to increase the number of gate operations that can be completed within the coherence time of the ion-qubits favoring the development of scalable quantum computers.},

  abstract = {The field of quantum computing has grown from concept to demonstration devices over the past 20 years. Universal quantum computing offers efficiency in approaching problems of scientific and commercial interest, such as factoring large numbers, searching databases, simulating intractable models from quantum physics, and optimizing complex cost functions. Here, we present an 11-qubit fully-connected, programmable quantum computer in a trapped ion system composed of 13 171Yb+ ions. We demonstrate average single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.5\$\$\textbackslash\%\$\$, average two-qubit-gate fidelities of 97.5\$\$\textbackslash\%\$\$, and SPAM errors of 0.7\$\$\textbackslash\%\$\$. To illustrate the capabilities of this universal platform and provide a basis for comparison with similarly-sized devices, we compile the Bernstein-Vazirani and Hidden Shift algorithms into our native gates and execute them on the hardware with average success rates of 78\$\$\textbackslash\%\$\$ and 35\$\$\textbackslash\%\$\$, respectively. These algorithms serve as excellent benchmarks for any type of quantum hardware, and show that our system outperforms all other currently available hardware.},
